## Getting Started
<br/>

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.
<br/>
## Folder Structure
<br/>
The workspace contains two folders by default, where:
<br/>
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- <br/>
- <br/>
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
<br/>
Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
<br/>
> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
<br/>
## Dependency Management
<br/>
The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
